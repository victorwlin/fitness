This PWA is meant to be a comprehensive fitness app that tracks nutrition, exercise, and weight, but it is a work in progress, and the only functional aspect is the weight tracking. Currently it allows the user to log in with either their Google account or by creating an account with their email. Then the user can input their weight daily into the Cloud Firestore database and retrieve it whenever they log in.
